# GDPR - Cookie Expire

## Description

With the new General Data Protection Regulation for Europe, cookies must have a limited lifespan of thirteen months after their first deposit in the terminal equipment of the user (following the expression of the consent).

Currently an Analytics cookie is set for 24 months. Google doesn't allow to modify the life of the cookie natively yet.

Select the duration to set a time in seconds to use in Google Analytics tags / settings.

This variable helps you set a cookie duration when you set cookieExpire in the Set field without need to convert in second.
